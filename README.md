# mod_linkedincert

## Description

This plugin allows you to create certificates that can be automatically linked to a linkedin account. 
A button appears on the certificate page and automatically redirects to a form to add a certificate on linkedin.

Afterwards, visitors to the linkedin account can click on the certificate to obtain confirmation that the user has obtained the certificate.
